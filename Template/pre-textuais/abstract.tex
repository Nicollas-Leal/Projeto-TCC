This study proposes the development of a support guide for the design and implementation of systems aimed at users with low computer literacy. It recognizes that a lack of familiarity with digital tools represents a significant barrier to technological and social inclusion. The research seeks to identify metrics, principles, and interface components that can guide the creation of more accessible, intuitive, and effective software and websites for this audience. The adopted methodology is exploratory and bibliographic, based on the principles of Design Science Research, in order to construct a conceptual artifact — a guide and a component catalog — that gathers best practices in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), usability, and accessibility. The expected outcome is to contribute to the advancement of inclusive design and to provide developers and researchers with a reference for creating more accessible and democratic technologies.
